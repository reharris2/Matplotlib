## Three Observations:

-  The changes in Tumor Volume were observed over a 45 day period.  Only two drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane, showed a decrease in tumor 
   volume over this period, with percentage decreases of 19.48% and 22.32%, respectively.
-  The number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes were observed over time for each treatment.  I observed that Ramicane and
   Capomulin had the least change of any of the drugs, while Ketapril and the Placebo had the maximum change.
-  During the research, the survival rate of mice was observed against the type of drug used.  When mice were given Capomulin and Ramicane,
   their survival rates were higher of the course of research (84% and 80%, respectively), which is consistent with what was found in 
   the tumor value and metastatic tests.
